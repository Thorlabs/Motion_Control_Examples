## XA Python Examples

Before testing the examples, be sure to install the XA software from the Thorlabs website [here](https://www.thorlabs.com/software_pages/ViewSoftwarePage.cfm?Code=Motion_Control&viewtab=0). You will also need to install the xa_sdk_setup.zip file. This can be installed with pip using the following commands from the Windows Command Prompt

```
CD C:/LOCATION_TO_THE_ZIP_FOLDER
pip install xa_sdk_setup.zip
```

Once installed, the dll needed for these examples will be found on your PC here: C:\Program Files\Thorlabs XA\SDK\Native (C, C++)\Libraries
This should be copied to the location of the examples being run.
